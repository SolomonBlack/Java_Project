/*

The idea for this script is to simulate a typical moment
when you arrive at an atm

Steps for this include:
1. Arriving at the atm as someone with a card
2. Inserting card
3. Having the atm ask for a pin number
4. Entering the pin number
5. Having a series of options to choose from and choosing one
6. picking a number based off that choice
7. changing the persons account based off that number
8. Giving the user the option to quit or star over
9. end script
